# Setting Up Your Environment: R and RStudio

## Why R and RStudio?

-   **R:** A powerful, free programming language specifically designed for statistical computing and graphics. Widely used in academia and industry for data analysis, including genomics and breeding.
-   **RStudio:** An excellent, free Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R. It makes using R much easier with features like code highlighting, plot viewing, package management, and project organization.

## Installation Steps

1.  **Install R:** Go to [CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network)](https://cran.r-project.org/) and download the latest version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux). Follow the installation instructions.
2.  **Install RStudio:** Go to the [Posit website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) and download the free RStudio Desktop version for your operating system. Install it after installing R.
3.  **Install Quarto:** Go to [Quarto's website](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) and download and install Quarto for your system. RStudio often bundles Quarto, but installing the latest version is good practice.
4.  **(For PDF Output) Install LaTeX:** Open RStudio, go to the Console panel, and type the following commands one by one, pressing Enter after each:

``` r
# Run these lines in the R Console 
# install.packages("tinytex") 
# Run only once if you dont have it 
# tinytex::install_tinytex() 
# Run only once to install LaTeX distribution ``` 
This might take a few minutes. If it fails, consult TinyTeX documentation or ask instructors.

## Installing R Packages for the Course

We will use several add-on packages in R. You only need to install packages *once*. Use the R Console in RStudio.

``` r

# --- Run this code chunk in the R Console --- List of packages we will likely need:

packages_to_install <- c(
  "tidyverse", # For data manipulation (dplyr, tidyr) and plotting (ggplot2)
  "readxl", # For reading Excel files (.xlsx)
  "writexl", # For writing Excel files (.xlsx)
  "rrBLUP", # For Kinship calculation and basic GWAS
  "qqman", # For creating Manhattan and QQ plots for GWAS
  "vcfR"
)
install.packages(packages_to_install)

```

## Quick RStudio Tour

(We will cover this live, but key windows include: Console, Script Editor/Notebook, Environment/History, Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer). Familiarize yourself with these panes.
