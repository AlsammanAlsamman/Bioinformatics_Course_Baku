# Module 1.4: Reading and Writing Data

So far, we've created data inside R. But usually, your breeding data exists in external files, like Excel spreadsheets or CSV files. We need to get this data *into* R and save our results *out* of R.

## Common Data File Formats

-   **CSV (Comma Separated Values - `.csv`):** Plain text file where columns are separated by commas. Very common, easily readable by many programs (including R and Excel). **Often the best format for sharing data.**
-   **TSV (Tab Separated Values - `.tsv`):** Similar to CSV, but uses tabs to separate columns.
-   **Excel Files (`.xls`, `.xlsx`):** Native Microsoft Excel format. Can contain multiple sheets, formatting, formulas. Requires specific R packages to read/write.

## Paths, Working Directory, and RStudio Projects (Best Practice!)

R needs to know *where* to find your files.

-   **Working Directory:** The default folder location R looks in. You can see it with `getwd()` and set it with `setwd("path/to/folder")`, but **setting it manually is usually bad practice** because it makes your code non-portable.
-   **Absolute Path:** The full path from the root of your computer (e.g., `"C:/Users/YourName/Documents/BreedingData/trial1.csv"`). **Avoid this!** It breaks if you move folders or share your code.
-   **Relative Path & RStudio Projects (RECOMMENDED):**
    1.  Organize your work using an **RStudio Project**. Create one via `File -> New Project -> Existing Directory...` and select your main course folder (`course_project_baku`).
    2.  When you open the `.Rproj` file, RStudio automatically sets the working directory to that project folder.
    3.  Keep your data files *inside* the project folder, ideally in subdirectories like `data/raw` (original data) or `data/example` (cleaned data for examples).
    4.  Refer to files using **relative paths** starting from the project root, like `"data/example/phenotypes.csv"`. This makes your analysis reproducible and easy to share!

## Reading Data into R

We'll use functions from the `readr` (for CSV/TSV) and `readxl` (for Excel) packages. Make sure they are installed (see Module 1.1).

``` r
# Load the necessary libraries
library(readr)
library(readxl)
library(dplyr) # for glimpse

# --- Reading a CSV file ---
# Assumes you have a file 'sample_phenotypes.csv' in the 'data/example' folder
# relative to your project root.
pheno_file_path <- "data/example/sample_phenotypes.csv"

# Check if file exists before trying to read (good habit)
if (file.exists(pheno_file_path)) {
  # Use read_csv from the readr package (generally preferred)
  phenotype_data <- read_csv(pheno_file_path)

  print("CSV data loaded successfully:")
  head(phenotype_data)   # Look at the first 6 rows
  glimpse(phenotype_data) # See column names and data types

} else {
  print(paste("Error: Phenotype file not found at", pheno_file_path))
  phenotype_data <- NULL # Set to NULL if file not found
}

# Note: Base R has read.csv() - it works but readr::read_csv() is often faster
# and handles data types more consistently (e.g., doesn't default strings to factors).

# --- Reading an Excel file ---
# Assumes you have 'sample_trial.xlsx' in 'data/example'
excel_file_path <- "data/example/sample_trial.xlsx" # You'll need to create this file

if (file.exists(excel_file_path)) {
  # See what sheets are in the workbook
  excel_sheets(excel_file_path)

  # Read data from a specific sheet (e.g., "YieldData")
  # yield_data_excel <- read_excel(excel_file_path, sheet = "YieldData")

  # Or read by sheet number (first sheet is 1)
  # yield_data_excel <- read_excel(excel_file_path, sheet = 1)

  # print("Excel data loaded:")
  # glimpse(yield_data_excel)

} else {
  print(paste("Warning: Example Excel file not found at", excel_file_path))
}
```

-   **Always inspect your data after loading!** Use `head()`, `str()`, `glimpse()`, `summary()`. Did R read the column names correctly? Are the data types what you expected (numeric, character, etc.)?

## Writing Data out of R

After cleaning data or performing analysis, you'll want to save results.

``` r
# Load libraries if not already loaded
library(readr)
library(writexl)

# Let's assume we filtered our phenotype data (from previous module example)
# Make sure phenotype_data exists first
if (!is.null(phenotype_data)) {
  # Example: Create a subset of high yielders (Yield > 11, assuming Yield column exists)
  # Check if Yield column exists before filtering
  if ("Yield" %in% names(phenotype_data)) {
     high_yielders <- phenotype_data[phenotype_data$Yield > 11, ] # Adjust threshold as needed

     # --- Writing to a CSV file ---
     # Use write_csv from readr. It doesn't write row numbers by default.
     output_csv_file <- "output/high_yielders_output.csv"
     write_csv(high_yielders, output_csv_file)
     print(paste("High yield data saved to:", output_csv_file))

     # --- Writing to an Excel file ---
     # Use write_xlsx from writexl. Can write multiple data frames to different sheets.
     output_excel_file <- "output/analysis_summary.xlsx"
     sheets_to_write <- list(
       HighYielders = high_yielders,
       OriginalDataSummary = summary(phenotype_data) # Example: write a summary too
       # Add other results data frames here
     )
     # write_xlsx(sheets_to_write, path = output_excel_file)
     # print(paste("Analysis results saved to:", output_excel_file))

  } else {
    print("Column 'Yield' not found in phenotype_data. Cannot filter or write.")
  }
} else {
  print("phenotype_data object does not exist. Cannot write data.")
}
```

**Exercise:** If you have a simple Excel file with some breeding data (e.g., Plot ID, Variety, Yield), try reading it into R using `read_excel()`. Inspect the loaded data frame using `glimpse()`.
